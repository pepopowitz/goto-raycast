A "wormhole": a shortcut connecting two distant points in spacetime. It's like a tunnel with two ends, each at separate points in spacetime. For example, a wormhole could connect two regions of space that are far apart, or it could connect two different times.

Uhhhhhh except it interprets shortcodes, expands them to a URL, and opens a browser. No space or time travel.
